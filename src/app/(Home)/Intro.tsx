            <p className="text-center text-white">
                I started my journey to become a software engineer over a decade ago. I've done remote work for freelance clients and startups,
                all while  collaborating with talented people to create digital products for both  business and consumer use.
                I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on learning anything and everything about computers.
