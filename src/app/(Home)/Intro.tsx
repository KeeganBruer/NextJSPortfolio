            <p className="text-center text-white">
                I started my journey to become a software engineer well over a decade ago.
                I&apos;ve done remote work for enterprises, freelance clients and startups, all while collaborating with talented people
                to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I&apos;m quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually
                working on learning anything and everything about computers.
