# Most Impactful Aspects of Software Engineering

<KeeganAuther {...articleInfo}/>

When creating software, I prioritize building tested and maintainable codebases. To prioritize
these qualities, I believe it is crucial to begin each project by planning and writing meticulous
technical documentation. Then once you have a plan that clearly defines your intended
outcomes, use-cases, and data-flow; you can proceed forwards with your Test Driven
Development.
